## Game Details

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.
Players alternate turns per move. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consits of moving a piece 
to an unoccupied square or one that is occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from 
the game. Each piece has it's own moveset.
