# CHESS

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.
Players alternate turns per move. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consits of moving a piece 
to an unoccupied square or one that is occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from 
the game. Each piece has it's own moveset.

- King: The king moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook.
- Rook: A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.
- Bishop: A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.
- Queen: The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal.
- Knight: A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the rank, file, or diagonal. The move forms an L-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
- Pawn: A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied; or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file. A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.

### Castling

Once in every game, each king can make a special move, known as castling. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the
first rank toward a rook (that is on the player's first rank and then placing the rook on the last square that the king just crossed. Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met:

- Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game.
- There are no pieces between the king and the rook
- The king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through any square is under attack by an enemy piece, or move to a square that would result in check.

### En Passant

When a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant ("in passing"), moving to the square the pawn passed over. This can be done only on the very next turn; otherwise the right to do so is forfeited.

### Promotion

When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. 

### Check

When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check.

### Victory

Games can be won in the following ways:

- Checkmate: The player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check.
- Resignation: Either player may resign

### Draw

Ways that a draw can happen:
- Stalemate: The player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check.
- Draw by agreement
